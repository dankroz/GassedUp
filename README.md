# Project-2

GassedUp gives you a comparison of the cheapest flights vs. a total road trip cost to destinations.

User will enter travel information: starting point, destination, dates of travel, passengers. 

# googlemaps API key billing info changed, need to update to get total mileage of trip
I used Toll Guru API to generate toll costs along the route and find states with tolls. 

We use Cheerio to scrape gas prices from AAA site and cross reference them with those states. 

# billing changed on flight api sites so looking to adjust
Then a couple different flight tracking APIs are used to generate flight costs.
